  Daveâ€™s basses are second to none. His meticulous attention to detail makes his
  instruments very comfortable, perfectly balanced and a joy to play. The
  construction is top notch and the tone is unbeatable. I am constantly being
  complimented on the sound and the beauty of the instruments. Besides being
  such a great work of art, his basses will deliver consistently show after
  show, I never have to worry about them delivering what I need. Simply put they
  are the best basses available.

Dave's basses are second to none. His meticulous attention to detail makes his instruments very comfortable, perfectly balanced and a joy to play. The construction is top notch and the tone is unbeatable. I am constantly being complimented on the sound and the beauty of the instruments. Besides being such a great work of art, his basses will deliver consistently show after show, I never have to worry about them delivering what I need. Simply put they are the best basses available.

Besides all that Dave is a great bassist himself, a cool guy to be around, and a joy to work with. Thanks  
Dave!
