Besides all that Dave is a great bassist himself, a cool guy to be around, and a joy to work with. Thanks

This NYBW is the most versatile bass that I have ever played period. When it comes to tone, intonation, action, presence, clarity, depth and consistency you can't ask for anything more. It is quite simply the best! I can't thank David enough for taking the time to get this out to me. Part of the reason why David Segal makes the best basses is probably due to the fact that he is an amazing bassist who has the gift and skill to translate his understanding of what a bass player needs into building an instrument that feels like it is an extension of one's self. David will go the extra mile to make sure you get the right axe, something that is a work of art and craftsmanship. It's an honor to be part of the NYBW family.

NYBW instruments are by far the best I've ever played. The Cremona 5 string is my main and favorite bass. The build quality is second to none. The playability and tone inspires me to create and play like no other bass can. Intense attention to detail, from wood selection to the input jack are taken to ensure that nothing but the best is delivered. My Cremona fits in whatever musical context I find myself in. Whether I'm in the studio, or playing live, from Latin music to Gospel music, my NYBW comes with me. It's a perfect combination of beauty and function. A bass built by a bass player, for bass players. This is my forever bass!
