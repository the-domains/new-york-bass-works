  Daveâ€™s basses are second to none. His meticulous attention to detail makes his
  instruments very comfortable, perfectly balanced and a joy to play. The
  construction is top notch and the tone is unbeatable. I am constantly being
  complimented on the sound and the beauty of the instruments. Besides being
  such a great work of art, his basses will deliver consistently show after
  show, I never have to worry about them delivering what I need. Simply put they
  are the best basses available.

Dave's basses are second to none. His meticulous attention to detail makes his instruments very comfortable, perfectly balanced and a joy to play. The construction is top notch and the tone is unbeatable. I am constantly being complimented on the sound and the beauty of the instruments. Besides being such a great work of art, his basses will deliver consistently show after show, I never have to worry about them delivering what I need. Simply put they are the best basses available.

Besides all that Dave is a great bassist himself, a cool guy to be around, and a joy to work with. Thanks  
Dave!

This NYBW is the most versatile bass that I have ever played period. When it comes to tone, intonation, action, presence, clarity, depth and consistency you can't ask for anything more. It is quite simply the best! I can't thank David enough for taking the time to get this out to me. Part of the reason why David Segal makes the best basses is probably due to the fact that he is an amazing bassist who has the gift and skill to translate his understanding of what a bass player needs into building an instrument that feels like it is an extension of one's self. David will go the extra mile to make sure you get the right axe, something that is a work of art and craftsmanship. It's an honor to be part of the NYBW family.
