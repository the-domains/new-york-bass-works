It is with great pride and satisfaction that we introduce to the world, the New York Bass Works Reference Series Bass Guitars.

These instruments are born from one young man's frustration with the sparse offerings of the early days of extended range basses. The Reference Series Basses are a product of one builder's search for the ultimate in tone and playability in the J bass platform - a platform that has endured for close to 60 years, nearly unchanged. David Segal, an avid collector, restorer, luthier, and professional bass player has had literally hundreds of these instruments under his fingertips. He is one of the few true experts when it comes to understanding what makes a great J bass ...a great J bass. His quest for the "ultimate" in tone and playability culminated in the founding of New York Bass Works, his own guitar company in 1997\.

The Reference Series Basses are instruments infused with the DNA of over 20 years of custom bass projects, complex renovations, and pain-staking repairs of nearly every brand of instrument. The empirical knowledge and raging curiosity that this professional bassist/luthier brings, is core to the understanding of how the instrument feels, responds under his fingers, through his body, amplification, and most importantly, his ears.

Not one to concentrate solely on the sound of the instrument, David has made the J platform more user -friendly and more balanced, with careful consideration regarding ergonomics and construction in the Reference Series bass guitar. After all, what good is an instrument if it causes fatigue? An instrument is a natural conduit for talent, and never an encumbrance to it. An instrument should clear the way for musical statements, and not cause the player concern about how it hangs on a strap when standing, or whether or not it balances properly when sitting. All of the aesthetics that affect playability are well addressed in our basses.

These are just a few of the many considerations making up the Reference Series Basses, and we look forward to sharing more in the very near future. We are excited as we move forward with the roll out, and begin receiving feedback from our clients who anxiously await their Reference Series basses.

As always, thank you all for your continued interest and dedication over the years, we really appreciate your support!
