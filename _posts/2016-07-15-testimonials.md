NYBW instruments are by far the best I've ever played. The Cremona 5 string is my main and favorite bass. The build quality is second to none. The playability and tone inspires me to create and play like no other bass can. Intense attention to detail, from wood selection to the input jack are taken to ensure that nothing but the best is delivered. My Cremona fits in whatever musical context I find myself in. Whether I'm in the studio, or playing live, from Latin music to Gospel music, my NYBW comes with me. It's a perfect combination of beauty and function. A bass built by a bass player, for bass players. This is my forever bass!

This NYBW is the most versatile bass that I have ever played period. When it comes to tone, intonation, action, presence, clarity, depth and consistency you can't ask for anything more. It is quite simply the best! I can't thank David enough for taking the time to get this out to me. Part of the reason why David Segal makes the best basses is probably due to the fact that he is an amazing bassist who has the gift and skill to translate his understanding of what a bass player needs into building an instrument that feels like it is an extension of one's self. David will go the extra mile to make sure you get the right axe, something that is a work of art and craftsmanship. It's an honor to be part of the NYBW family.

"For me consistency is the key to the instruments at NYBW. Whether I am recording, playing small clubs , or touring the large halls, the consistency of tone, the accuracy of the neck, and the overall durability of the instrument speak to the superior craftsmanship at NYBW".

The bass arrived safely and in one piece :-) and what can i say... i'm lacking of words. it's an awesome instrument. i felt comfortable from the first second although i've never played a 34.5" scale. it is so well balanced seated and standing it looks amazing and of course it sounds great. i had the chance to use it on a concert on friday for the first time for a kind of world music band where I'm subbing from time to time and everbody was extremly happy. the sound engineer said he had to do nothing just open the channel :-) i was using my walter woods eq flat and epifani 112 (the bass was played passive,tone control between quarter and half open) and i've been so happy on stage in every setting. i could always hear myself and i could always find a sound that fit the song. from a slow emotional ballad to funky james brown grooves. so what more can i say than thank you thank you thank  
you... it was worth waiting the time...

Hey David,

There isn't much to add to what has already been said by many others. The craftsmanship and playability of this instrument is off the charts. It exudes "effortless" playing, incredible tone and versatility. While playing it, there's a constant reminder that these instruments are very special. It doesn't fight you in any way and allows you to concentrate on the music. Quite simply...Thank you! Its an honor to have worked with you on this project and a privilege to own this bass.

Best Always,

Brian  
PS: I'll give you a call soon.
